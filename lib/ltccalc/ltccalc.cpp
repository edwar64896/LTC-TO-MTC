  Â 
   Simple timecode calculator for gDocs spreadshet. Heavily inspired by Nuke/Hiero Timecode Calculator Panel v1 by Matt Brealey. No support for obscure non even frame rates (yet).
   User have to have some sense since with the input we're not throwing errors for all odd cases possible.

   Drop frame support with the help of David Heidelberger's blog, http://www.davidheidelberger.com/blog/?p=29. David based his work on Andrew Duncan's math, http://andrewduncan.net/timecodes/.

   Works with both manually entered data and cell references.

   Takes two timecodes, framerate and an operation as input. =tc(tc1, tc2, fps, operation)
   tc1 = The first timecode, always a string or cell/range reference. E.g. "10:08:10:01", H34 or H34:H56.
   tc2 = The second timecode. String or cell/range reference for addition and subtraction, e.g. "00:01:04:15", G34 or G34:G56. For all other operations integer or float, e.g. 5.4. When converting between framerates with "conv" this is the new target framerate, e.g. 24.
   fps = source framerate. Always integer. E.g. 24
   operation = Any of "add", "sub", "div", "mult", "per", "conv", "2tc", "2f". E.g. "add".  All modes not that usefull...

   supported framerates: Any integer frame rate such as 24, 25, 30, 60. 29.97, "29.97df", 59.94, "59.94df". You must type "" around the dropframe framerates.


   "add"  : tc1 + tc2. Both TC formatted as HH:MM:SS:FF. E.g ("00:08:43:12", "00:07:12:03", 24, "add")
   "sub"  : tc1 - tc2. Both TC formatted as HH:MM:SS:FF. E.g ("05:04:13:09", "00:00:08:23", 25, "sub")
   "div"  : tc1 / tc2. tc2 in this case is the divisor as an integer or float, NOT HH:MM:SS:FF. E.g ("05:04:13:09", 2, 24, "div")
   "mult" : tc1 * tc2. tc2 in this case is the multiplier as an integer or float, NOT HH:MM:SS:FF. E.g ("12:45:32:23", 5, 24, "mult")
   "per"  : tc1 * (tc2/100). tc2 in this case should be an int or float, NOT HH:MM:SS:FF.
   "conv" : will convert tc1 to the framerate given as tc2. tc2 in this case should be target framerate as an integer. E.g ("00:12:30:11", 25, 24, "conv")
   "2tc"  : will convert tc1, here given as frames, to timecode. Value for tc2 is ignored and is best left blank.
   "2f"   : will convert tc1 to frames. Value for tc2 is ignored and is best left blank.

   I really don't know this shit so feel free to come with suggestions and feedback. =)
   @version v0.6

   Changelog
   2014-06-17, v0.3.   Conversion of tc had the framerates mixed up.
   2014-06-19, v0.35.  Added autocomplete and help.
   2014-06-27, v0.351. Conversion of frames to tc and vice versa added.
   2014-09-21, v0.5.   Combined the experimental version that works with ranges and the original single cell based version. Hope I didn't break anything, let me know if I did. =)
   2014-09-22, v0.52.  29.97, 29.97 drop frame, 59.94 and 59.94 drop frame support. Not 23.976 at this time since that's a fictional thing... =)
   2015-03-29, v0.6.   Rewrote loads of the code. Had to remove what was started with inter-column calculations for now. Made sure drop frame works.

/**
   A simple timecode calculator capable of adding, subtracting, dividing, multipling, percentage operations, conversion between framerates, conversion from frames to tc and vice versa.
    Now works with ranges, e.g: =tc(B36:B42, ,24,"2f").


   @param {"10:08:10:01"} tc1 The first timecode, always a string or cell/range reference. E.g. "10:08:10:01", H34 or H34:H56
   @param {"00:01:04:15"} tc2 The second timecode. String or cell/range reference for addition and subtraction, e.g. "00:01:04:15", G34 or G34:G56. For all other operations integer or float, e.g. 5.4. When converting between framerates with "conv" this is the new target framerate, e.g. 24.
   @param {24} fps Source framerate. E.g, 24, 25, 30, 60, 23.976, 23.98, 29.97, 59.94, "29.97df", "59.94df"
   @param {"add"} operation Any of "add", "sub", "div", "mult", "per", "conv", "2tc", "2f". E.g. "add"
